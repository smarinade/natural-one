Good morning my precious little contraption,

As the rest of our troupe is preparing to move out for the day, I figured I would stud you some more... What’s that, another story? Very well. I will tell you how Vivor, Dru, Alduin, Richard and I came to travel together. 

After being framed for a crime I did not commit, I found myself trapped in a cell with about a dozen other captives in a drow elf slave camp, toiling away in a mine and waiting to be sold off to gods know where. The lot of us agreed we had to work together to leave this place and took action at a surprising rate. Fortunately for us, one of the guards was rather disgruntled about being demoted from the private guard to the __priestess of Lolth__ running the camp. He arranged for the prison door to remain unlocked one fateful evening and off we went into the darkness! Or, so we thought.. I could have left what little belongings I had behind, but some of us required their weapons and armaments to survive in this damp, dark, demon-ridden realm. So we took a little detour and ended up in the armoury. The guarded armoury. After a brief struggle we managed to subdue the guards stationed there and ran off with whatever equipment we could find.  

Unfortunately for us, breaking into a door and causing a ruckus does not quite aid in a stealthy escape, so our troupe was quickly followed by a detachment of the guards, led by the priestess herself! Through cunning use of his mage hand, Richard managed to activate the elevator and lead the weaker ones (such as the twins Topsy and Turvy), down. Knowing even at that time that Richard is treacherous demonspawn and not to be trusted under any circumstance ever, I stood by at the top of the platform to make sure he didn’t do anything dangerous and try to drop them from lethal distance on the ground. Naturally, that is exactly what happened... Luckilyt, everyone eventually made it to the ground unscathed thanks to my timely reaction! One brave companion (whose name eludes me at the moment), sacrificed himself to hold the guard regiment occupied on the suspended bridge connecting two platforms of the complex while we made our escape. Noticing her prized captives had already made it to the bottom, the priestess, in a bout of recklessness and rage, plunged herself into the darkness into an underground lake to try and give chase. As I noticed what she was doing, I prepped up a quick spell to freeze the bottom of the waterfall leading into the lake, resulting in a huge, spiked ice formation waiting for its hapless victim to make contact. It was a gruesome sight my little contraption it’s good you don’t store visual memories... After quickly dispatching some oozes lying in wait for us near the bottom, we picked up anything useful we could find and made our way into the unknown. 

_Oh my , look at the time! I know Vivor takes his sweet time bathing but even then I think I might be a bit tardy with prepping up for today’s journey. Time to hide you again, before someone else finds you.._
