What's this? Hello, anybody there? I saw Arcturus talking to you the other day. So I thought you were some wizardy thing. But you look just like a normal object. Hmm, I feel this energy. It's like you're a living being. It's like you can hear me. Can you hear me? Do you understand me? I feel like you do. It's sometimes so difficult talking to anybody here. The sun will rise in an hour or so. I'm so bored. My other companions need more sleep than I do, so I'm bored almost every night. Do you want to keep me company? It would be nice to share all the events with you. 

Today was a rough day. It started this morning. I always check on my companions, just to make sure everything is all right. I knew Arcturus cast a spell that would keep anybody out of our beds, and pockets. So I was quite confident nothing bad had happened when I woke up. Still, I always check. Imagine my surprise when I found __one bed empty__. Well, couldn't be too surprised, with Devin. So I checked outside, no Devin. I decided to hide in a corner and see when (and if!) he would turn up. Half an hour or so before sunrise, I suddenly saw the door handle move. If I hadn't been staring at the thing, I wouldn't even have noticed it! You can say a lot of things about Devin, and I will, but he is one good pickpocket. He went to bed and then I made my move. I snuck up to him and surprised him for once, with my dagger near his throat. We went outside to talk so we wouldn't wake anybody else. He tried to fight me but failed miserably. Eventually, after a lot of threats, which I didn't like at all, or maybe a little, it was Devin after all, he told me the truth. He was __slave shopping__! Could you believe that! Slave shopping! Ow, better lower my voice a bit. Of course when the others woke up, I told them everything and we decided to hunt down the slave traders. 

>"We get money for the slave traders? Let's hunt them down and kill them all!"
><cite>Richard finally growing a conscience</cite>

Devin told us we could only find the slave traders at night, so we had to spend the day doing something. Sir Vivor and Richard went to the commanders post and blew Vivor's cover. Arcturus, Devin and I went to the magic shop. 

>"How about I give you one gold piece to change my name?"
><cite>Sir Vivor trying to bribe an official, nice try</cite>

At night, we went to the slaver's den with a foolproof plan. Or so we thought. Devin and Richard posed as slave traders, Alduin was already a bounty hunter so no changes there, Arcturus and Sir Vivor were invisible and I changed myself into a fearsome wolf. We got in without any problem, so far our plan worked perfectly. Sadly enough, we didn't think the next part through. And we especially didn't expect treachery! I still get mad when I think about it. That stupid, disloyal, faithless, false-hearted, deceitful, back-stabbing, double-crossing, two-faced (or no faced!), undependable ...

_Ow, sorry Alduin, didn't mean to wake you. Go back to sleep. I'll be quiet._
_Sorry spirit, I'll continue this story tomorrow._
