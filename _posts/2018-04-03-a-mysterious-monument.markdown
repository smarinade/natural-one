_Ah, there you are.. I thought I’d lost you. You seem a bit different somehow. Like a shift in your very core. I must investigate this later._

We finally managed to rid Riverdale of its orc problem. After patiently waiting for them to assault the walls, we unleashed the fury of the elements upon them and their war machines and drove them back. They were slaughtered, but we had no choice, these orcs would stop at nothing. I worry about Drusilla though, she seemed to enjoy frying those orcs a bit too much... Fire is a dangerous element. Still, I guess I shouldn’t  judge, I don’t know her history with the beasts.

While investigating their camps, we found a sacrifice on an altar, a human sacrifice.. Luckily no further evidence suggested demon interference, but I should remain cautious. I have not forgotten my family’s score with the creatures of the abyss and I will have revenge for father.

Having no real objective after liberating the city, we decided to venture forth into the unknown once more and boarded a ship bound for an uncharted island. Our captain and contact is called Richard (yes I know what you’re thinking, but this one seems much more mentally stable and enjoyable than the other one. Still if I had the choice I’d have gone with a captain with any other name). He seemed unsure of where to go, but then again that might have been because of the alcohol in his body (yes I know, but still far more reliable than the other Richard).

After a few days of smooth sailing, we ran into some bad weather. Really. Bad. Weather. Dru’s control of the elements was not enough to see us through safely, but on the upside we got to make a cool entrance on a flying killer whale. Too bad the island was uninhabited and no one was around to see it. But was it really uninhabited..?
A mysterious tower in the middle of the island drew the attention of Vivor and me. I sensed great magic power surrounding it and pulsing from within. It is inhabited by a creature named Ilphas, which I assume is both the owner of the tower and the source of this magic I sense. Our unseen host lured us through a magic teleportation circle with promises of tests (and I am no man to turn down tests, I love tests!). 

The first test was a bunch of riddles, solved easily enough by our combined intellect. I just worry about what else this creature has in store for us..

This will have to do contraption, peering into you, I see you use this round ocular piece to spy on us. I wonder who’s watching.. Hello?
